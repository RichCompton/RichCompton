- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @RichCompton a.k.a Dr01dmasta && N1nja
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ...
  Documenting my studies thoroughly and creating something of interest and use to others.
  Making friends! Penetration-Testing, primarily, but Defensive Security and programming as well. The whole tech community at large is my pride and joy, really.
  I've never met a better motley crew of good, positive people from all walks of life united by their common goals and nothing but supportive of each other.
  I learned Python first after getting my first computer in years with the first COVID stimulus check. Special thanks to Cory Althoff for getting me started and 
  making this journey seem possible for someone like me and to Codecademy for sponsoring me to use their materials for 3 months and help catapult me further into
  programming. Last, chronologically, but certainly not least a very special thanks to Offensive Security and Jim O'Gorman who have been CRUCIAL in defining my 
  path as I undertake this journey and giving me both the challenge & opportunity to do things I never thought myself capable of before.
  My joy is really hacking. Finding new tools, methodologies and
  the process of earning certifications is the most satisfying
  - üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...
  EVERYTHING. Primarily how to meet people and network in this industry. Loooking for my first job as a developer or Pen-Tester/Security expert.
  I'm somewhat fluent in Python and Javascript and currently studying for my
  OSCP, actually starting the PWK tomorrow at the time of writing. 
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ...
 I may be hosting pen-testing writeups here as well as various beginner-intermediate level programming projects
  I have done or am yet to do in Javascript(React, Node, Express), Python3, SQL, MongoDB and hopefully a C language soon enough.
  IF OF COURSE I MANAGE TO FORCE MYSELF TO ACTUALLY PUSH MY RESEARCH. I'M SERIOUSLY TERRIBLE ABOUT IT. I HAVE PROBABLY 50 PROJECTS (from my time studying programming
  my first 4 months) SITTING ON MY HARDDRIVE, MAYBE 
  LOST... :(
